`tori.dev` is my personal website which you can view [here](https://tori.dev). The goal was to create a portfolio that was served using an API for easily updating my projects and articles with clean, well documented code.

This MVP was created in only **4 days**: 1 to design the website, and 3 to code and ship.

Written in React and Sass, and served via my [authenticated Django API](https://t0ri-make-school-coursework.github.io/create-portfolio-backend/#/).

Code quality was enforced using the ESLint Airbnb style guide!

These designs were made in InVision Studio on the Monday of my M-Th sprint.

I initially wireframed them on paper through several iterations.
